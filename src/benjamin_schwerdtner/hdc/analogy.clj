;; Analogy
;;

;; ============================================

;;
;; Hofstadter:
;; - Analogies are the essences of situations.
;; - A concept is a city in concept space, it's outskirts are the /concept halo/.
;; - During development, the concept cities of a child grow.
;; - Copernicus (1543): The moon concept becomes the concept of 'moons'.
;;   Moon is a general class of a planet-satilite relationships, of which earth-luna was the prototype.
;; - Such processes are 'concept maturation'.
;;
;;
;; Observations:
;; - planet-satilite relationships: The essence of the situation, the structure of the analogy.
;; - Minksy frame:
;;   skeletton:    { :planet , :satilite }
;;   filled:       { :planet earth, :satilite luna }
;;
;; - Analogies tolerate a certain amount of 'conceptual slippage' (Hofstadter)
;;
;;
;; Analogies on analogies:
;;
;;    Mother    : child      :: Planet : satalite
;;    Container : containand :: Planet : satalite
;;
;; - sort of fits, given a certain amount of slippage.
;;
;;
;;
;;
;; Modeling Analogies
;; -------------------------------
;;
;; - An Analogy model should model:
;; - a concept space,
;; - a prototype operator (HDC: 'seed')
;; - concept maturation operators... ?
;;   (the holy grail)
;; - A strong concept structure model, 'what matters' in a situation (the holy grail... ),
;;   Minsky: Frame
;; - given a new situation: concept retrieval, mapping and inference (see below).
;; - Implement concept halo
;; - Implement slippage (but philosophical question, what is this slippage?)
;;   Naive idea: slippage of an analogy is higher, the larger the concept halos are that are mapped in the analogy.
;;   -> too naive, because slippage can also allow to completely flip a part of an analogy structure.
;;      Only 1 flip out of an otherwise 'good fit' might constitute small slippage.
;;
;;
;;
;;
;;
;; Concepts should be a primitive datastructure
;; --------------------------------
;;
;; - I would expect a concept to be a primitive datastructure in a cognitive system, into which
;;   submodules hook into.
;; - For instance a language module should be able to map concepts to words, etc.
;; - Neocortex is a structure that seems to support such a 'everything coming together' notion.
;; - Neuronal Ensembles (DeNo, Hebb, Abeles, Braitenberg, Yuste, Pulvermueller, ...)
;;   are argued to be the 'neuronal letters' (BuzsÃ¡ki) of the brain.
;; - And are a candidate for a fundamental datatype of cognition.
;;


;;
;; Perception:
;; ---------------------
;; - Translating a sitation to a point/region in concept space. (psychology: 'categorization')
;; - Since I'm a fan of 'The Brain Inside Out' (BuzsÃ¡ki 2019),
;;   I imagine the concepts themselves to have an active role.
;;   A system that has a default behaviour, and internal dynamics -
;;   As opposed to a system that translates, given inputs.
;; - Sensor data in this view is more of a resource to the already active perceptions.

;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_space
;;
;; A concept space is similar to a word2vec high dimensional space.
;;
;; - points denote objects
;; - regions is a concept
;;
;; HDC is a natural fit to model CST!
;;


;; crucial insight: that the HDC framework could operationalize the
